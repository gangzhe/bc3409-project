"what I meant by 'protective of their cash', is that they wouldn't be able or willing to fund $AMRS commercial launches even if they bought them with shares. $DNA doesn't solve $AMRS problems. Someone like $PG could scale them if they can't do it alone."
"Something like a $PG acquisition or large acquirer is a safe option, but it massively limits upside potential."
"The tech platform has a lot of value regardless. $DNA is not the natural acquirer, very little synergies. And they are very protective of their cash. $AMRS mainly needs cash and distribution network from a buyer. Someone like a $PG would be a good buyer."
