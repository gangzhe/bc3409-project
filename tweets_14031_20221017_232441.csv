So $GOOG is about 33% undervalued assuming a 10% growth rate (current EPS estimates). It is more undervalued if you think growth rate is higher or Aaa bond rates will go down.
The growth rates are different. If you look at the multiple Buffett put on $WPO of 40x it implied about a 16% 7-yr growth rate is 8.5+2g adjusting for 6.1% rate vs. 4.4% when Grahams formula was derived. $GOOG has about a 10% growth rate going forward implying a 28.5x multiple.

"$AAPL - by far, both most shares and most value. I worry I have too much, then I check $BRK holdings and I stay the course."
at least that's how I'd frame a bull case for $BRK vs SPY and some of the other current opportunity set
SPY has gone from high multiple on inflated earnings to fair mult. on inflated earnings $BRK has gone from fair mult. on normalized earnings to lower mult. of normalized earnings + lower valuation regime and cap. returns = faster IV growth and better chance for price to = IV
"the $BRK of a lower valuation regime and capital returns is unequivocally&gt;than the $BRK of a higher valuation regime and cash hoard the question is if, and then by how much better than SPY"

"$NVDA have been beaten down bad, so a recovery bounce is probably in the works, or it could go into a great downfall. Possible chop Monday, but this week's earnings are too great of implied moves with $NFLX and $TSLA ahead. Play the days trend. Dont predict. (Reminding myself)"
"But be mindful, if it bounces off 111, we could go to 113 and bounce off that support to 115 where would encounter our first resistance. Fly pass 115, we go to 118, then our nemesis of 120. Break 120 and we got a mini bull rally ahead for $NVDA."
"But this twitter account is about $NVDA! So, looking at NVDA I noticed the price is going to 111 where we have good support. If it breaks under, it can run to 108-109 again. If it break that, we could be seeing 100 very soon. Under a 100 we could see 70s"
FYI; Long Term I have zero interest BTD on PAST market leaders. Ex $NVDA $AMD I started accumulating individual secular growth in May. These are stocks I think will be future market leaders. Most trading at 2008 Valuations currently.

"$ABBV Morgan Stanley Lowers AbbVie PT To $185 From $188, Overweight Rating"
So the best way to look at $ABBV is either to look at P/FCF or just use Buffetts advice on amortizations
$ABBV amortizations have increase several fold as of FY20 (due to the Allergan acquisition) Most of the intangible assets ($76 B) are still from the Allergan acquisition
"If you see low double digit forward P/E estimates for $ABBV just ignore it (unless it comes with an estimate of share price cut in half) There will be a $7+ billion amortization gap at least until 2026 between Net Income (&amp; EPS) and Operating Cash flow ""- Capex"" (&amp; P/FCF)"
$ABBV TTM Net income $12.6 B FCF $ 22.2 B This means P/E 20 P/FCF 11 The large difference comes mostly from amortizations $7.4 B These are part of cost of products sold in the Earnings statement impacting Net Income but added back in operating cash flow (not a cash outflow)

"Coca-Cola $KO stock now yields 3.1%. Investors that bought the stock 3-5 years ago with a starting yield of at least 3.1% have earned 8.2% to 10.9% annual returns since then. A great, mature business that keeps ploughing ahead (something that is appreciated more these days)."

"Not that he cares what I think or that he views BRK as a P.A., but not selling $KO in the late 90s has to be one he would reconsider (even with the tax hit). It was trading in the 40-50 P/E range &amp; was sub 2% FCF Yield with sales &amp; operating growth slowing. Can't argue with $AXP."

"Simple pair trade idea. Long $ko short $pep. Comparable p/e, +0.5% dividend, strategic for a healthy consumer long term. Downside, recession leads to unhealthy habits and pepsi upside. This PoS was granted a license to price gouge during supply side inflation of decoupling."
"Look at all the dip buyers. $JPM, $PYPL, $TSLA, $MS, $KO, $WMT for example. Most of this was expected, next will be Q3 earnings w/2023 guidance drops. After that, the bottom will be closer to being in. A lot of quality long term holds here for the brave."
